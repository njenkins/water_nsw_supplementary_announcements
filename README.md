This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

* PDFs on the web suck

Currently this scraper returns the title, url,year and month/year of publication where it is available.
Link / date format is inconsistent, however where at least a month/year is able to be extracted a timestamp value is also generated
Maybe someone can build something useful with this information.
