This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io). To get started [see the documentation](https://morph.io/documentation)

* PDFs on the web suck

Currently this scraper returns the title, url and year of publication.
Link text is inconsistent, which makes extracting a complete date tricky.
However i'm hoping to add this in the future.

Maybe someone can build something useful with this information.
